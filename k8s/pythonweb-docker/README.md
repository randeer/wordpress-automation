## Argo CD for Kubernetes Application Delivery

This project utilizes Argo CD for efficiently managing and maintaining the state of the root website in a Kubernetes environment.

##### **Argo CD Features**
- **GitOps Workflow**: Argo CD follows the GitOps paradigm, allowing for declarative definition and versioning of the desired application state using Git repositories.

- **Continuous Delivery**: Automate application delivery through continuous deployment of Kubernetes manifests defined in your Git repository.

- **Web UI and CL**I: Easily visualize and manage the state of your applications through the Argo CD web user interface or command-line interface.

##### Why Argo CD?
In a Kubernetes environment, managing the state of the root website is critical for ensuring stability and reliability. Argo CD provides a robust solution by synchronizing the desired state defined in your Git repository with the actual state of the Kubernetes cluster.
